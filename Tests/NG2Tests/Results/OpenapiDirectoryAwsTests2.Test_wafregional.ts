With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use. </p> </note> <p>Creates a <a>RateBasedRule</a>. The <code>RateBasedRule</code> contains a <code>RateLimit</code>, which specifies the maximum number of requests that AWS WAF allows from a specified IP address in a five-minute period. The <code>RateBasedRule</code> also contains the <code>IPSet</code> objects, <code>ByteMatchSet</code> objects, and other predicates that identify the requests that you want to count or block if these requests exceed the <code>RateLimit</code>.</p> <p>If you add more than one predicate to a <code>RateBasedRule</code>, a request not only must exceed the <code>RateLimit</code>, but it also must match all the conditions to be counted or blocked. For example, suppose you add the following to a <code>RateBasedRule</code>:</p> <ul> <li> <p>An <code>IPSet</code> that matches the IP address <code>192.0.2.44/32</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>A <code>ByteMatchSet</code> that matches <code>BadBot</code> in the <code>User-Agent</code> header</p> </li> </ul> <p>Further, you specify a <code>RateLimit</code> of 1,000.</p> <p>You then add the <code>RateBasedRule</code> to a <code>WebACL</code> and specify that you want to block requests that meet the conditions in the rule. For a request to be blocked, it must come from the IP address 192.0.2.44 <i>and</i> the <code>User-Agent</code> header in the request must contain the value <code>BadBot</code>. Further, requests that match these two conditions must be received at a rate of more than 1,000 requests every five minutes. If both conditions are met and the rate is exceeded, AWS WAF blocks the requests. If the rate drops below 1,000 for a five-minute period, AWS WAF no longer blocks the requests.</p> <p>As a second example, suppose you want to limit requests to a particular page on your site. To do this, you could add the following to a <code>RateBasedRule</code>:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A <code>ByteMatchSet</code> with <code>FieldToMatch</code> of <code>URI</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>A <code>PositionalConstraint</code> of <code>STARTS_WITH</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>A <code>TargetString</code> of <code>login</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p>Further, you specify a <code>RateLimit</code> of 1,000.</p> <p>By adding this <code>RateBasedRule</code> to a <code>WebACL</code>, you could limit requests to your login page without affecting the rest of your site.</p> <p>To create and configure a <code>RateBasedRule</code>, perform the following steps:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Create and update the predicates that you want to include in the rule. For more information, see <a>CreateByteMatchSet</a>, <a>CreateIPSet</a>, and <a>CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use <a>GetChangeToken</a> to get the change token that you provide in the <code>ChangeToken</code> parameter of a <code>CreateRule</code> request.</p> </li> <li> <p>Submit a <code>CreateRateBasedRule</code> request.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use <code>GetChangeToken</code> to get the change token that you provide in the <code>ChangeToken</code> parameter of an <a>UpdateRule</a> request.</p> </li> <li> <p>Submit an <code>UpdateRateBasedRule</code> request to specify the predicates that you want to include in the rule.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create and update a <code>WebACL</code> that contains the <code>RateBasedRule</code>.

If you add more than one <code>Rule</code> to a <code>WebACL</code>, AWS WAF evaluates each request against the <code>Rules</code> in order based on the value of <code>Priority</code>. (The <code>Rule</code> that has the lowest value for <code>Priority</code> is evaluated first.) When a web request matches all the predicates (such as <code>ByteMatchSets</code> and <code>IPSets</code>) in a <code>Rule</code>, AWS WAF immediately takes the corresponding action, allow or block, and doesn't evaluate the request against the remaining <code>Rules</code> in the <code>WebACL</code>, if any. </p> </li> </ul> <p>To create and configure a <code>WebACL</code>, perform the following steps:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Create and update the predicates that you want to include in <code>Rules</code>. For more information, see <a>CreateByteMatchSet</a>, <a>UpdateByteMatchSet</a>, <a>CreateIPSet</a>, <a>UpdateIPSet</a>, <a>CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet</a>, and <a>UpdateSqlInjectionMatchSet</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create and update the <code>Rules</code> that you want to include in the <code>WebACL</code>. For more information, see <a>CreateRule</a> and <a>UpdateRule</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create a <code>WebACL</code>. See <a>CreateWebACL</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use <code>GetChangeToken</code> to get the change token that you provide in the <code>ChangeToken</code> parameter of an <a>UpdateWebACL</a> request.</p> </li> <li> <p>Submit an <code>UpdateWebACL</code> request to specify the <code>Rules</code> that you want to include in the <code>WebACL</code>, to specify the default action, and to associate the <code>WebACL</code> with a CloudFront distribution. </p> <p>The <code>ActivatedRule</code> can be a rule group. If you specify a rule group as your <code>ActivatedRule</code> , you can exclude specific rules from that rule group.</p> <p>If you already have a rule group associated with a web ACL and want to submit an <code>UpdateWebACL</code> request to exclude certain rules from that rule group, you must first remove the rule group from the web ACL, the re-insert it again, specifying the excluded rules. For details, see <a>ActivatedRule$ExcludedRules</a> . </p> </li> </ol> <p>Be aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to a web ACL without setting the rule type when first creating the rule, the <a>UpdateWebACL</a> request will fail because the request tries to add a REGULAR rule (the default rule type) with the specified ID, which does not exist. </p> <p>For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block HTTP requests, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/">AWS WAF Developer Guide</a>.</p>

For each <code>XssMatchTuple</code> object, you specify the following values:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>Action</code>: Whether to insert the object into or delete the object from the array. To change an <code>XssMatchTuple</code>, you delete the existing object and add a new one.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>FieldToMatch</code>: The part of web requests that you want AWS WAF to inspect and, if you want AWS WAF to inspect a header or custom query parameter, the name of the header or parameter.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>TextTransformation</code>: Which text transformation, if any, to perform on the web request before inspecting the request for cross-site scripting attacks.</p> <p>You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You use <code>XssMatchSet</code> objects to specify which CloudFront requests that you want to allow, block, or count. For example, if you're receiving requests that contain cross-site scripting attacks in the request body and you want to block the requests, you can create an <code>XssMatchSet</code> with the applicable settings, and then configure AWS WAF to block the requests. </p> <p>To create and configure an <code>XssMatchSet</code>, perform the following steps:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Submit a <a>CreateXssMatchSet</a> request.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use <a>GetChangeToken</a> to get the change token that you provide in the <code>ChangeToken</code> parameter of an <a>UpdateIPSet</a> request.</p> </li> <li> <p>Submit an <code>UpdateXssMatchSet</code> request to specify the parts of web requests that you want AWS WAF to inspect for cross-site scripting attacks.</p> </li> </ol> <p>For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block HTTP requests, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/">AWS WAF Developer Guide</a>.</p>
